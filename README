RSS syncing server built with Sinatra and Redis (could be a redis cluster even)
The goal is to allow for a simple system to setup syncing the read/unread/whatever
status of news items in a timeline. The same system would work for things like
instagram and twitter as well as RSS.

Things not done yet:
- User authentication
- Input validation
- Battle hardening
- Subscription list syncing (partly implemented)
- Testing ( I am developing a command-line-based rss reader to use to test the syncing system's facilities )
